# This bootstrap script pulls the latest repository from the internet, and updates the build script. It is step 1 in a 2 step process. After executing, it calls the 2nd script

# ATTENTION: This script is not for use on student LAMP stacks...

# For changes in this file to take effect, it must be moved to the execution directory on the server manually.

# TODO verify that sousms-new does not exist

# Pull the latest repository from GitHub
git clone git://github.com/nordquip/sousms.git /var/git/sousms-new/

# TODO Check to see if the Git repository was pulled correctly. If github is down, build script fails. Should exit buildscript if does not download.

# Copy the new build-script to the correct cronjob location
cp /var/git/sousms-new/src/build/serverBuildScript.sh /var/git/serverBuildScript.sh
