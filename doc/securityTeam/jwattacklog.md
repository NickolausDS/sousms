####Description attack 1
The exploit I found to try on the server is for wireless access hacking. It allows you to 
power on the local network.
####Where was it found
I found the information on this exploit on the fuzzy security website. www.fuzzysecurity.com
This site has tutorials and coding examples for performing several different types of attacks on a system.
####What is its name?
it is the WACgv2.0 attack
####Did it work?
The security team has been told we can no longer attack the server so we currently do not have a server
to try the exploits on. When we have one I will be able to try the attack. 

####Description attack 2
This attack is a vulnerability for those running Microsoft Windows on their system. It is an exploit
that gives the attacker full access to your system. 
####Where was it found
I found the information and directions on how to run it on Securitytube.com watching video's on Metasploit
and BackTrack 5. 
####What is its name?
This exploit is the MS-03-026 exploit
####Did it work?
Same as before, we do not currently have access to a server to attack so I was unable to test the exploit
as of yet.
